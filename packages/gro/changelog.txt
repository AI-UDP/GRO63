New in beta.5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* New command: zoom(z) sets the gui's zoom level.
* time() returns the current world time
* dump(fp) writes the id, position, orientation, volume, and reporter values for
  each cell to a .csv file
* Save Colony Information from the File menu calls dump as well.

New in beta.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Reactions among signals can be declared with, for example, reaction ( {A,B},{C}, 1.0 ),
  which represents the reaction A+B->C. Here, A, B and C must be already delcared as signals.
  See the example spatial_oscillations.gro for a cool demo.
* You can now zoom in and out!
* Use set ( "population_max", n ) to change the maximum number of cells.
* Use the menu item Simulation->Increase Population Limit or command-M to increase
  the limit on the number of cells by 100.
* Use, for example, ecoli ( [ volume := 2.0 ], program p() ) to initialize the
  volume of an ecoli cell.
* Change the signal grid size and extent with set and "signal_grid_width",
  "signal_grid_height", "signal_element_size".
* The extent of the signal area is now indicated graphically in the gui by
  cross hatches.
* To run without the gui, invoke grong (which stands for gro, no gui), from the
  command line. grong is compiled without linking to Qt, so it is small.
* Examples of how to call grong from Mathematica are now included in the extras
  directory.

New in beta.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Minor	bug fixes

New in beta.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Finished porting all functionality of the old gui (exemplified in
version a.5) to the new Qt gui.
* Except -n does not work anymore.
* Now works with Windows!
* File I/O via fopen and fprint.
* Turn on chemostat mode with chemostat(true|false) command.
* Chemostat width and height are settable parameters.

New in beta.1 (Mac only)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* New gui with buttons, separate work thread
* Releases are now in .dmg files
* The executable is now stuck in a Mac OS X .app bundle and has a pretty icon
* Themes are now settable in gro -- see gro.gro for examples
* print() now prints to the console -- and you can use html tags in what you print.

New in a.5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Now there's a changelog!
* Command line now available via ARGV, ARGC.
* New built in function: ( map_to_cells expr end ) returns expr evaluated for each cell.
  See examples/maptocells.gro.
* New keyword: ( foreach i in L do expr end ). See examples/foreach.gro.
* Default parameters are settable outside a cell and initialized in include/gro.gro.
  Also, many parameters now have "ecoli_" prefixes, to pave the way
  for cell-type specific parameters.
* You can now start the simulation automatically with start().
* run and tumble!
* The -n option (after the filename) starts gro without the gui.
